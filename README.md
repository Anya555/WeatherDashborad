# WeatherDashborad

WeatherDashboard is an app that allows a user to see current weather and 5-day forecast for the city they search for. Each city that users search's for gets added to dynamically created list.

* Technologies used to build an app:

- Bootstrap for CSS grid and components
- jQuery  for building app functionality
- Third Party API - OpenWeather API to get weather forecast
- AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format
- Localstorage to store persistent data

* Current weather condition includes:

- City
- Date
- Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- UV index

* 5 day forcast includes:

- Date
- Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
- Temperature
- Humidity

I had to make 3 different ajax calls in order to recieve data for a current day weather, 5 day forecast and  uv index.
